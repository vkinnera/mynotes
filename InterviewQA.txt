Interview Questions Q/A

ACCENTURE INTERVIEW - OLD
1) Mulesoft API end to end process. 
ANS:
it may be the mixed of two questions.
API LIFE CYCLE?
--> create RAML - RESTFUL API MODELLING LANGUAGE  - we provide resource, input, output, datatype
-> 	Publish RAML to exchange
-> Review RAML and getting the feedback
-> if positive - build stage else go to design stage ie., RAML 
-> In build stage we do the API development.
-> After development of API we do the testing stage - MUNIT testing
->  we will secure API's applying policy like client id enforcement, ratelimiting etc
-> After deploying in cloudHub -> 	we should moniter application in cloudHub 
--> troubleshooting - bugs and then managing the API's.

generally we will call an API using HTTP requestor connector
form process to system and from experience to process layer 
generally we will call using HTTP requestor.
some time we develop connector like we create for system layer and publish to exchange.
use that connector in process layer.

2) traits vs fragments. 
Ans:

how do we do validation in raml. 

how do we hand over raml to client after designing. 

post vs put vs  patch. 

need of put & post. 

foreach vs parallel foreach   

scatter-gather. 

spike control vs rate limiting policy. 

Munits. 

deployment model (through jenkinspipeline).

how many records can we process in a batch? 

can we call batch fom trigger? 

map vs mapObject? 

what is Idempotency?what is this use 

what is scheduler? 

which flow can we call from lookup function? 

how to handel error in process layer? 

what is the output for for each? 

what is the file we used to secure password? 

what is CI/Cd pipeline?have you used in your project? 

how to improve the performance of an application? 

how do you setup the dependencies in your project? 

if you need to save the state of the transaction and then resume it if it fails? 

what is synchronous and asynchronous?  

what is diff b/w api kit router and api ki console? 
  
can we validate the incoming payload from RAML? 

what dataweave inbuild functions you used? 

how can we call flows from dataweave? 

have you involved in documentation side or deployment side? 

have you created any proxys in api manager?
