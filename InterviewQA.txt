
Interview Questions Q/A

ACCENTURE INTERVIEW - OLD
1) Mulesoft API end to end process. 
ANS:
it may be the mixed of two questions.
API LIFE CYCLE?
--> create RAML - RESTFUL API MODELLING LANGUAGE  - we provide resource, input, output, datatype
-> 	Publish RAML to exchange
-> Review RAML and getting the feedback
-> if positive - build stage else go to design stage ie., RAML 
-> In build stage we do the API development.
-> After development of API we do the testing stage - MUNIT testing
->  we will secure API's applying policy like client id enforcement, ratelimiting etc
-> After deploying in cloudHub -> 	we should moniter application in cloudHub 
--> troubleshooting - bugs and then managing the API's.

generally we will call an API using HTTP requestor connector
form process to system and from experience to process layer 
generally we will call using HTTP requestor.
some time we develop connector like we create for system layer and publish to exchange.
use that connector in process layer.

2) traits vs fragments. 
Ans:
TRAITS:
traits is reusable component where we can define headers, queryParams, URI params inside traits.

Traits is used for headers and queryParameters -- 
Traits should be imported using "Traits" keyword(by creating key: !include filePath) 
and it is referred using "is" keyword with these[]( is:[headersname,.....,...]traits:
for calling the external traits we will use is: [] keyword.A trait can have all kinds of attributes.

Traits are used to store common headers or queryParams or UriParams.
we can include / refer traits by using the traits: keyword.
traits:
  correlation-id-header:
and to include traits inside resource we use is:[correlation-id-header] keyword

FRAGMENTS:
fragments are the reusable components of RAML. To make design and build of a resusable API even quicker and easier.
categorized into two types - local and global
and types of fragments are
Traits
ResourceType
Library
DataType
user documentation
Example
Annotation Type
Security Scheme

how do we do validation in raml? 
Header and queryParam validation is done by editing the APIKIT router configuration after importing RAML in anypoint studio.

how do we hand over raml to client after designing. 
API Specification Portal
MuleSoft Anypoint Exchange: If using MuleSoft, you can publish the RAML API to Anypoint Exchange, where clients can access the API specification, documentation, and other resources.

post vs put vs  patch. 
1. HTTP PUT 
This updates or Creates a resource. It is idempotent. Multiple identical requests will update the same resource. 
 
2. HTTP POST 
This is used to create new resources. It is not idempotent, making two identical POST will duplicate the resource creation. 

3. HTTP PATCH 
The PATCH method applies partial modifications to a resource.

need of put & post. 

foreach vs parallel foreach  

for each process is single threaded and it process the records one by one and parallel for 
each is multi threaded and it process multiple records at the same time in parallel way
parallel ForEach - o/p- the output of this scope is the collection of the results of each route and the aggregated results will be in the same order they were, prior to the split. 
for each - o/p same orginal payload it doesnt modify the payload 
foreach
payload after and before for each - same
Variable after and before for each - changes(what ever we will configure in last loop )
parallel for each
payload after and before parallel for each - changes(collection of all payload in parallel for each)
variable after and before for each - same
the variable created inside the parallel for each will not exists after parallel for each

scatter-gather. 

https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/latest/scatter-gather-concept

spike control vs rate limiting policy. 

Munits. 

deployment model (through jenkinspipeline).   

vcore vs worker. 
Workers give the computational skills to the application. 
vcore is memory size that is assigned to a worker(mule instance) like we assign 8gb or 16gb ram to a system.
Increasing the number of vcores from lower to higher is vertical scaling.
Increasing the workers is horizantal scaling like if one worker handles 1000 requests per minute then 2 workers handles 2000 requests per min.

error handling. 

VM vs flow refference. 

Active MQ. 

issues faced in production,deployment. 

object store,cache. 

load balancer. 

data weave (string to array, reverse, multivalue selector). 

scenario based questions on try scope,scatter-gather, re-connection stratgy.

ACCENTURE INTERVIEW - NEW - ME
intro?
tell me about project?
RAML - traits, datatypes?
What are policies are used in your project - clientId enforcement, basic authentication, Oath policy.?

How can we define multiple queryParams in URL?
ANS: To send multiple query parameters we use the "&" ampercent symbol. 
example: http://localhost:8080/covid/v1/cases?place=texas&zip=839102
to access the particular queryParams we use attributes.queryParams.zip in code

hi everyone 
I am vamsi
Iam from nellore 
i studied bachlor of technology in electronics and communication engineering from svce in tirupathi.
I have 3 + years of experience at capgemini and Iam having 2+ years relevant experience in mulesoft.
Currently iam working  as mulesoft developer in capgemini and 

coming to my project I am working in telecom domian project and the  client is CWC - cable and wireless
for that particular client I am working in project called cco digital
and my resposibity in capegemini is to develop design and testing API's using mulesoft software.
my project follows API life cycle to develop API's.

i have worked on a api called Post refund in which we have used api led connectivity structure 
in these we have three layers 
redmound ux as experience layers 
payment management biz as process layer 
aria management sys as a system layer 
in this we get inputs from frontend called fastgo payments 

From the frontend we get required inputs like business id, payment id, targetSystem which are passed into the ux, 
In ux we do the validations for inputs and later it is routed to the biz layer using request connector. 

In payement management biz depending upon the business id and target system we will route it to the sys layer 

aria management system is connected to the backend and retrive the data, 
in this we mapped using transform message and created a request to the backend to get the account no and details which is required for refund 
after getting the acc details we have done the validations for date. 
after the validations are done and again we mapped with the account details and payement id using transform message and created request to the backend 
now the refund is done from the backend and we get response like "refund is Intiated". 

transform message takes the request message and transformed into required mule format.
