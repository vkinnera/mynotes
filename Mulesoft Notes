What is difference between function and variable in DW?
we cant pass input parameter  in variable but in function we can pass input parameter
what is traits and datatypes in mulesoft
resource is a collection of traits and data types
traits - headers, uriparams and queryParams are defined in traits
datatypes
 datatypes define structure of body it can define request or response like http status code
 200, 400 , 500 etc

what is difference between for each parallel for each and batch processing

for each process is single threaded and it process the records one by one and parallel for 
each is multi threaded and it process multiple records at the same time in parallel way

batch processing process the multiple records at the same time and it contains batch step - 
it contains processors and aggregators batch job and On complete stage

processors process the records based on accept policy and aggregrator combine the records.

in On Complete we do the meta data processing 

what is implementation URL
when we deploy mule application jar in cloud hub it generates one URL that is our implementation 
URL.
we use this URL with basepath to call an API.

to remove non funtional requirement 	(apply policy , SLA ) we can create proxy url on 
top of implementaion URL.

API auto discovery?
to connect the application deployed in mule runtime with API manager.
In cloud hub deployment we  have api manage where we apply policies and non functional requirements
In mule runtime where we deploy mule application code
if we want to connect application deployed in mule runtime we need auto discovery.
request - gateway - API Manager ( check and full fill policy and SLA )  if it is full fill it will go to
API Implementation in mule runtime.
API manager has this client Id enforcement.

difference  between v core and worker
v core is a unit of worker
worker is a smallest unit where we can deploy our mule application
0.1 vcore - 500 mb heap memory
0.2 vcore - 1gb heap memory
1 vcore - 2gb heap memory

MUNIT
Assert Operations
Assert: validate mule event content
equals
expression
that
mock when
mock event processor when it matches the defined name and attributes
spy
what happens when befor and after event process is called
verify
verify if the process is called
Fail
allow you to fail test case on purpose
behavior 
see all conditions before executing test logic.
mock and spy goes into this condition
execution 
meant for testing the logic which will wait for all the processess 	to get completed 
before executing the next scope
runs flow through this section	 
validation
assert and verify comes here to validate and verify the flow

allows you to set payload attributes and variables
normally defined at the beginning of the m unit test to define the first message to the 
set
 you can define many properties
 what is pluck function and map function and mapObject?
 pluck function iterates over an object returns array of keys values and indices. - key value index
 map function iterates over an Array returns array - index, value
 mapObject iterates over an Object returns Object - key value index
 What is distinctBy?
 Iterates over an input and returns unique elements in it.
 What is joinBy function in Dataweave?
 merges an array into a single string value and uses the provided string as a separator between
 each item in the list.
 
 what is domain project?
 domain project is common mule project where we can keep all common mule resource 	which can be 
 used by multiple mule project which can be deployed in same runtime.
 
 we cant use domain project for cloud hub deployment model	since in cloud hub we deploy more than one
 project within same runtime that is worker.
 
 so it can be used only used in Onpremise deployment model.
 
 
why skipNullOn is used?
to skip all the null values from the respose

what is reduce function in dw?
Applies a reduction expression to the elements in an array.



API LIFE CYCLE?
--> create RAML - RESTFUL API MODELLING LANGUAGE  - we provide resource, input, output, datatype
-> 	Publish RAML to exchange
-> Review RAML and getting the feedback
-> if positive - build stage else go to design stage ie., RAML 
-> In build stage we do the API development.
-> After development of API we do the testing stage - MUNIT testing
->  we will secure API's applying policy like client id enforcement, ratelimiting etc
-> After deploying in cloudHub -> 	we should moniter application in cloudHub 
--> troubleshooting - bugs and then managing the API's


Available timezones for datatime converstion?
java!java::util::TimeZone::getAvailableIDs()

CICD or how do deploy
code - write scripts regarding  the jenkins file - it will take that code from the repo
build the code - after build it deploy on server.

once code is checkin it will deployed on server or if we need to deploy in UAT OR QA after code checkin 
we need approval and after approval we will deploy into the server.

devops teams writes pipeline scripts and we will deploy the code in jenkins by using the jenkins file.

what are the policies that you ave worked on?

Ratelimiting(throttling) - rate limiting is used to control the number of api call 
we can call the external system and the external system has some limit if the more than 
limited req will come then we will get out of memory as error message.
Spike control (throttling)- It is similar to rate limiting but we define the size of queue what ever the size
of queue if the size of queue is completed we will take another queue.

basic auth - 
client Id enforcement - 
JWT token - 
Oauth - 
HTTP Caching - 


how to call subflow file using dataweave
file - readURL
flow - lookUp


how to call configure properties in dw
p('propertyname')

when we use VM connector flow, where do we use
to use VM queue provided from the mulesoft.

Rate limiting is the way where we limit the number of request from the user side 
429 limit exceeded.

throtlling
maximum number of reqests that can be processed with in a given time frame the excess request can be 	
can be managed, cancelled or processed in some other way
we use mule cache component first time we call from the external system then we will get the
response from cache.
